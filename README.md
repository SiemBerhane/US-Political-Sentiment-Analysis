# US-Political-Sentiment-Analysis
 
This project was made for my AQA A Level Computer Science NEA.

It was written in Python and made use of multiple libraries such as pandas, scikit learn, the Twitter API, PyQt for the display and others.

The program collected around 1000 tweets that mentioned either the Democrats or Republicans and applied a naive bayes machine learning model to analyse them. This decided if the tweets had a negative or positive sentiment.
It then displayed the findings along with other data collected to the user

This project, along with the written document, received an A grade.
